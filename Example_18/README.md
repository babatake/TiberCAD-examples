üí° Notes

    The tight-binding model enables atomistic resolution, capturing effects like valence band mixing, strain, and piezoelectric fields, which are critical in GaN quantum dots for optoelectronic devices.

    You can tune quantum dot size, shape, or surrounding material to investigate confinement effects.
