üß™ Files Included

    diode_1D.geo
    GMSH geometry file defining a one-dimensional structure along the x-axis, including:

        "p" and "n" regions (for the p-type and n-type sides)

        "anode" and "cathode" contact points

    diode_1D.tib
    TiberCAD input file defining:

        Two regions with different doping types:

            p-side: acceptor doping (e.g. 1e17 cm‚Åª¬≥)

            n-side: donor doping (e.g. 1e16 cm‚Åª¬≥)

        driftdiffusion module to simulate electrostatics and carrier transport

        sweep module to vary the bias voltage and obtain I-V characteristics

üí° Notes

    This example is a fundamental building block for more complex devices like LEDs, photodiodes, and bipolar transistors.

    The simulation includes recombination effects (e.g. Shockley-Read-Hall) and doping profiles to model real device behavior.
