üìÑ Example: Basic 1D Bulk Semiconductor Simulation

This example demonstrates a basic 1D drift-diffusion simulation of a lightly doped bulk semiconductor using TiberCAD, aimed at visualizing electric potential, carrier concentration, and current flow in a homogeneously doped structure.
üß™ Files Included

    bulk.geo
    GMSH geometry file defining a simple 1D simulation domain along the x-axis with:

        A single semiconductor region (e.g., silicon or compound semiconductor)

        Contact points at each end of the device

    bulk.tib
    TiberCAD input file that configures:

        Region and material (e.g., silicon)

        Doping concentration (typically uniform donor or acceptor)

        Use of the driftdiffusion module to solve Poisson and carrier continuity equations

        Boundary conditions (e.g., ohmic contacts or applied bias)

        Output settings for potential, electric field, and carrier distributions

üîç Simulation Description
