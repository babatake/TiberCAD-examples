Example 21: TB parallel simulation of a InGaN/GaN SQW LED 

This example shows a complete simulation of a InGaN/GaN SQW LED including
random alloy effects, as has been used to produce the results of PRL 116, 027401 (2016).
Use of MPI parallelization is described.

Note: for meaningful results, the in plane supercell size of the atomistic structure should be increased.
