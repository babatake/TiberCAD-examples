Example 12: Quantum and optical properties of  a GaN  quantum disk in a nanocolumn LED 

NOTE: Memory allocation limitations in Win32 applications may lead this example to crash
      on certain windows PCs due to unsufficient physical memory. In that case, you can
      run the qdisk_win.tib input file, which does not compute optical properties and needs
      less memory.
