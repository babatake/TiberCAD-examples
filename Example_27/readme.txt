In this test we calculate strain and polarization in an InGaN/GaN QW with 20% In as a function of tilt angle. Piezoelectric coefficients are taken from Romanov et al., JAP 100, 023522 (2006), for comparison purposes. Moreover, for a few selected growth directions we check the atomistic structure and the calculate kp and ETB ground states.


At the same time, this examples shows how to run more complicated tests.
