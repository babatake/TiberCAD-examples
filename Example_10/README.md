This example demonstrates a quantum mechanical simulation of a quantum dot structure using TiberCAD, focusing on quantized energy levels and spatial wavefunctions.
üß™ Files Included

    quantum_dot.geo
    GMSH geometry file defining the spatial structure of a quantum dot, likely as a 2D or 3D domain with:

        Quantum dot region

        Matrix or barrier regions

        Discretization suitable for solving quantum confinement problems

    quantum_dot.tib
    TiberCAD input file that configures:

        Material assignment (e.g., InGaAs dot in GaAs matrix)

        Quantum region setup using Region or Cluster definitions

        efaschroedinger module using Envelope Function Approximation (EFA) to compute:

            Bound states (energy levels)

            Envelope wavefunctions

        Optional atomistic or valence-force-field settings (if defined)

üîç Simulation Description

    Structure: Single Quantum Dot

    Dimension: Typically 2D or 3D

    Modules Used: efaschroedinger

    Goals:

        Solve for quantized electronic energy levels

        Analyze spatial confinement and wavefunction shapes

        Understand the impact of material and size on quantum states

    Output Format:

        .dat for eigenvalues and density of states

        .vtk for spatial fields and wavefunction visualization in ParaView

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

tibercad quantum_dot.tib

Open .vtu or .vtk files in ParaView to visualize bound state wavefunctions.
üí° Notes

    This example is suitable for modeling single quantum dot systems used in quantum optics, single-photon sources, or QD-lasers.

    For multi-dot systems or Coulomb interactions, the simulation can be extended using more advanced modules or coupling with Poisson solvers.
